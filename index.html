Welcome to the [Taxonomics Engine manual](https://taxonomics.github.io/engine/).

The Taxonomics Engine gives you the tools you need to radically realign your business (and, specifically, its website) to the needs of your marketplace.

### Building together
6
This version of the tool is release 1, and as such you have an opportunity to strongly influence the direction of development. Well done, you early adopter you. As a result, you will find niggles and annoyances. Please [report them as an issue](https://github.com/Taxonomics/engine/issues) and we will get on to them as soon as possible.

Logging in is simple - just type in the user name and password you have been provided with. If you have forgotten it, email info@taxonomics.co.uk, or give us a call on +44 (0)330 223 1164.

Once you have logged in to the system with your username and password, you are presented with the menu screen. It will offer one or more of the following data visualisation tools (depending on the status of your taxonomics programme): 
12
​
13
- Competition Universe
14
- Market Taxonomy
15
- Performance Landscape
16
- Demand Architecture
17
- Search Integration

Once you have selected a visualisation, you can always see this menu again in a fold out panel revealed by clicking the menu icon (three stacked horizontal lines) found at the top left of each visualisation.

# Basic Interactions
22
The basic ways of interacting with each of the visualisation tools are similar to Google Maps.
23
​
24
 - **Zoom in and out** with the mouse wheel, or pinch on a tablet. If a circle is not labelled, simply zoom in on it. The label will appear once the circle gets big enough.
25
 - **Pan** by dragging.
26
 - **Select** by clicking. This will expand that cluster into a detailed taxonomy.
27
   
28
 Some visualisation tools also provide the following:
29
 
30
 - **Search** by clicking the search input at the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
31
 - **Change to and from a grid layout** using the grid icon at the upper left corner of the screen, below the menu icon.
32
 - **Change view settings** using the icons at the top right corner of the screen.
33
  + **Cog icon** gets you a view filters panel. This is (at the moment) also where you can download an SVG of the current view.
34
  + **Alphabetic order icon** (an A-Z beside a downward pointing arrow) if present, re-orders the grid layout alphabetically.
35
  + **Quantity order icon** (four horizontal bars, left aligned, of decreasing size, together with a downward pointing arrow) if present, re-orders the grid layout by value, largest first.
36
​
37
As you zoom, the navigation panel will appear at the bottom right of the screen. A blue box shows where you have zoomed to within the overall view.
