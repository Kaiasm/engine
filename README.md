# Welcome

Welcome to the Taxonomics Engine manual.

The Taxonomics Engine gives you the tools you need to radically realign your business (and, specifically, its website) to the needs of your marketplace.

## LOG IN
Logging in is simple - just type in the user name and password you have been provided with. If you have forgotten it, email info@taxonomics.co.uk, or give us a call on +44 (0)330 223 1164. Once you have logged in to the system with your username and password, you are presented with the menu screen. It will offer one or more of the following (depending on the status of your taxonomics programme): Competition Universe; Market Taxonomy; Performance Landscape; Demand Architexture; Search Integration.

## COMPETITION UNIVERSE
*See how you sit in a whole universe of micro-competitions.*

### Reading the universe map
The universe consists of a large pack of 'planets'. Each of the planets represents the visits arriving from people to a single website.
By default, the view of the universe you are presented with shows the top 100 such 'planets' by total number of search visits tracked. Your website sits at the centre of the universe (naturally). The area of each planet's surface is proportional to the number of visitors from search (whether organic/natural or paid) across 12 months.

If the data is present in the system, you may see one or more additional visual elements on each planet.

 - Coloured northern polar cap: area is proportional to the number of search visits to the website which your domain competed for (i.e. was seen in the same set of search results). The colour will be red at the beginning of a taxonomics programme, although may change as sectoral data comes into play.
 - White southern polar cap: area is proportional to the number of search visits to the website which were simply navigational searches to that website (people typing in the brand name of the web site, for example)

## MARKET TAXONOMY
*Explore what people want, in what number, and the words they use. It also allows you to decide what you want to do about that.*

### The Clusters

### A Detailed Taxonomy

### Taxon Triage

### The Detailed Taxon Report


## PERFORMANCE LANDSCAPE
*Tactical maps of where you are competing now, and where next.*

## DEMAND ARCHITECTURE
*Helps you to radically align your offering, and especially your category hierarchy and web information architecture, with the structure of the demand in the competitive universe in which you operate.*

## SEARCH INTEGRATION
