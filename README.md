Welcome to the [Taxonomics Engine manual](https://taxonomics.github.io/engine/).

The Taxonomics Engine gives you the tools you need to radically realign your business (and, specifically, its website) to the needs of your marketplace.

### Building together
This version of the tool is release 1, and as such you have an opportunity to strongly influence the direction of development. Well done, you early adopter you. As a result, you will find niggles and annoyances. Please [report them as an issue](https://github.com/Taxonomics/engine/issues) and we will get on to them as soon as possible.

# Log In
Logging in is simple - just type in the user name and password you have been provided with. If you have forgotten it, email info@taxonomics.co.uk, or give us a call on +44 (0)330 223 1164. 

Once you have logged in to the system with your username and password, you are presented with the menu screen. It will offer one or more of the following data visualisation tools (depending on the status of your taxonomics programme): 

- Competition Universe
- Market Taxonomy
- Performance Landscape
- Demand Architecture
- Search Integration

Once you have selected a visualisation, you can always see this menu again in a fold out panel revealed by clicking the menu icon (three stacked horizontal lines) found at the top left of each visualisation.

# Basic Interactions
The basic ways of interacting with each of the visualisation tools are similar to Google Maps.

 - **Zoom in and out** with the mouse wheel, or pinch on a tablet. If a circle is not labelled, simply zoom in on it. The label will appear once the circle gets big enough.
 - **Pan** by dragging.
 - **Select** by clicking. This will expand that cluster into a detailed taxonomy.
   
 Some visualisation tools also provide the following:
 
 - **Search** by clicking the search input at the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
 - **Change to and from a grid layout** using the grid icon at the upper left corner of the screen, below the menu icon.
 - **Change view settings** using the icons at the top right corner of the screen.
  + **Cog icon** gets you a view filters panel. This is (at the moment) also where you can download an SVG of the current view.
  + **Alphabetic order icon** (an A-Z beside a downward pointing arrow) if present, re-orders the grid layout alphabetically.
  + **Quantity order icon** (four horizontal bars, left aligned, of decreasing size, together with a downward pointing arrow) if present, re-orders the grid layout by value, largest first.

As you zoom, the navigation panel will appear at the bottom right of the screen. A blue box shows where you have zoomed to within the overall view.

# The Competition Universe
*See how you sit in a whole universe of micro-competitions.*

## Reading the universe map
The universe consists of a large pack of 'planets'. Each of the planets represents the visits arriving from people to a single website.
By default, the view of the universe you are presented with shows the top 100 such 'planets' by total number of search visits tracked. Your website sits at the centre of the universe (naturally). The area of each planet's surface is proportional to the number of visitors from search (whether organic/natural or paid) across 12 months.

If the data is present in the system, you may see one or more additional visual elements on each planet.

 - **Coloured northern polar cap**: area is proportional to the number of search visits to the website which you contested (i.e. where your site was seen in the set of search results that resulted in that visit to a competitor). The colour will be red at the beginning of a taxonomics programme, although this may change as thematic data filters come into play.
 - **White southern polar cap**: area is proportional to the number of search visits to the website which were simply navigational searches to that website (people typing in the brand name of the web site, for example). These are the things you can't really compete for... people who have already decided on that particular site, and just want to navigate there.
 - **Grey middle region**: this is the ocean of opportunity; the search visits that your competitor is winning that you are not contesting.

### Planet Details
Hovering over a planet with a mouse brings up its name in a tool tip. Clicking (or tapping, if using a tablet) makes the name stick in place, enabling you to then click the link to that domain, should you wish. To unstick the tooltip, click the 'X' icon in its top right corner.

### Things to try 
 - **See more of the universe** by clicking on the cog icon at top right. Change it from 'top 100' to, say, top '1000'. You can type it in or move the slider. If you take the slider all the way to the right, it will show you all domains in your market universe. If you do that, you may need to go and make a cup of tea while it lays them out.
 - **Change how the universe is ordered** by clicking the cog icon and changing the value metric from the number of search visits (the default) to:
   + **% contested visits**. This shows the competitors who are most like you in the market goals you are both meeting.
   + **# contested visits**. This shows the competitors with whom you are, in sheer numbers of people, competing with most fiercely. There are often surprises in here.   
 - **See the universe as a grid** by clicking the grid icon at top left, just below the menu icon. Re-order the grid alphabetically or by value by clicking on the sort view icons at top left, near the cog icon. Click the grid again to return to the normal universe view.

*Note: we are currently seeing some issues with ordering layout for large numbers of competitors in the non-grid view. Small domains are managing to squeeze between gaps left by larger, closer domains. This will be resolved in the next release. In the meantime, look at the grid view for confident ordering.*
 

# The Market Taxonomy
*Explore what people want, in what number, and the words they use. It also allows you to decide what you want to do about that.*

## The Circles
The first view you will see shows the first level of the taxonomic hierarchy so far produced as circles. Thematic groups are shown by colour. Click on a circle to expand it into a detailed taxonomy. CLick on it again to return to the circes view.

## A Detailed Taxonomy
The detailed taxonomy view extends a line of blocks out from the circle. Each block represents the demand for one of the things that people in your competition universe are looking for, and the names they give it. A single 'demand goal', is expressed in a number of ways - it has 'synonyms'. Each synonym refers to exactly the same goal. It does not include sub-types of the goal... for example, the number of people searching for *womens red shoes* does not include those searching for *womens red shoes size 3*, but does include those searching for *red womens shoes*.

Each demand block shows a number of things about the goal.
 - The number of people who searched for it over 12 months. The larger the block, the greater the number of people who are looking for it, and finding it in your competition universe. 
   + The block label gives the number of visits measured in the data set (a conservative measure... it's likely higher). A value estimate is also given, based on an average value-per-visit you have given us. The value is meant purely to help you to assess the value of better aligning your site to the goal versus other activities within your organisation that need your time and attention.
 - the most frequently used name people give to their goal. This is the label used for the block, and is the most frequently used of the synonyms found for that goal.
- The alignment of the words on your website to the names people give to the goal. If the block is empty, we cannot find any of the ways people expressed the goal on your web site. If it is full to the brim, you have matched every name people give to their goal.
 - The organic tactical opportunity available to you, based on who else in your competition universe is competing for this goal in natural (i.e. not paid) search results. If we think that, all else being equal, we would expect your domain to rank higher than those currently ranking for it, then the tactical opportunity will approach the size of the the face of the demand block.
 - The year on year trend in the number of people trying to meet this goal in your competition space. Increasing numbers of people wanting the goal results in a bubble which rises higher, and a block which slopes up towards you.

The block shows the level of *strategic demand* for the goal. The bubble shows the level of *tactical opportunity* avaiable to you right now in your competition space.

### Things to try
 - Click a demand block to bring up a panel with a list of each of the synonymous expressions used to give a name to the goal. Depending on the performance data you have made available to us, there may be a *More details...* link for, well, more details.
 - Click the grid icon on the left, just below the menu icon, for a tabluated, sortable view of the taxonomy.
   
## Taxon Triage
Taxon triage is the name we give to the process of rapidly deciding which of the many demand goals in your competition universe that your organisation wishes to support, and how soon you think you could support it.

 - **Not Triaged** - these are demand goals you have not dealt with. This also serves as an 'I don't know' state during a fast triage process.
 - **Active** - If you already have a page on your site that fully matches the goal either as the main focus of that page, or as a subsection of that page, *and the goal been explicitly linked to that page*, then it is deemed as 'active. This doesn't mean that your work here is done, but further improvement sits within the performance landscape.
 - **Now** - If you can do something about meeting a demand goal right now (you already have the content or products, you just need to build a page), then it should be Triaged into the 'Now' part of your to-do list.
 - **Soon** - You know you want to meet it, but it's going to take you a few weeks to pull otgether what you need for the page. That is something you will want to deal with 'soon'. 
 - **One Day** - You know you want to meet it, but this one's going to be more complex. It might involve bringing on a new supplier, or a new subject specialist to write the content. If it's gogin to takes months, not weeks, then it should be put into the 'One Day' part of the to do list.
 - **Never** - No, no and no. This is not a thing that you want to support. We don't throw these away, as strategies can change in time... but they are placed into 'neverland', for ignoring most of the time.

# The Performance Landscape
*Tactical maps of where you are competing now, and where next.*

The performance landscape shows all the demand goals identified so far, and their triage states. If a triage state of 'now' is set, and the demand goal is linked to a URL on your site such that it is deemed 'active', you can begin to colour in your performance landscape. The more you fill each actively supported goal with the names people give the goal, the brighter it gets. Pale cells in the landscape are barely relevant, and need work! As time progresses, so will the landscape, growing gradually more complete.

### Things to try
 - click on a cell to bring up more information about it. If it is not yet linked to a page on your web site, the detailed report shows whether the names people give to their goals are used anywhere on your website. If it is linked to a page, it shows whether the names are used on that page. If we have performance data, it will also give clues as to possible improvements in the flow of people from impression to visit, visit to engagement, engagement to transaction. Opportunity values are estimated where possible.
 
 
# The Demand Architecture
*Helps you to radically align your offering, and especially your category hierarchy and web information architecture, with the structure of the demand in the competitive universe in which you operate.*

The demand architecture visualises the things people want in a series of tree structures. Each goal held in the tree is a branch from the most frequently desired of its possible 'parents'. Curved lines show alternative 'parents', where they exist. This is the starting point of a demand architecture process, where you uncover how best to structure the goals you will support around the shape of the demand within your competition space.

At present this is simply a visualisation tool; depending on the programme of works, it may become a way of comparing your current website information architecture with the idealised structure of the demand in the competition space, and give you a clear path to improvement.


# Search Integration
*Supercharge your on-site search engine with deep taxonomic, ontologic and semantic goodness.*

Depending on the programme of works, you may have a search supercharging area. This may take the form of a on-demand data download customised to your internal search technology, or an API reference.
