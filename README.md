Welcome to the Taxonomics Engine manual.

The Taxonomics Engine gives you the tools you need to radically realign your business (and, specifically, its website) to the needs of your marketplace.

# Building together
This version of the tool is release 1, and as such you have an opportunity to strongly influence the direction of development. Well done, you early adopter you. As a result, you will find niggles and annoyances. Please [report them as an issue](https://github.com/Taxonomics/engine/issues) and we will get on to them as soon as possible.

# Log In
Logging in is simple - just type in the user name and password you have been provided with. If you have forgotten it, email info@taxonomics.co.uk, or give us a call on +44 (0)330 223 1164. 

Once you have logged in to the system with your username and password, you are presented with the menu screen. It will offer one or more of the following data visualisation tools (depending on the status of your taxonomics programme): Competition Universe; Market Taxonomy; Performance Landscape; Demand Architecture; Search Integration. Once you have selected a visualisation, you can always see this menu again in a fold out panel revealed by clicking the menu icon (three stacked horizontal lines) found at the top right of each visualisation.

# Basic Interactions
The basic ways of interacting with each of the visualisation tools are similar to Google Maps.

 - **Zoom in and out** with the mouse wheel, or pinch on a tablet. If a circle is not labelled, simply zoom in on it. The label will appear once the circle gets big enough.
 - **Pan** by dragging.
 - **Select** by clicking. This will expand that cluster into a detailed taxonomy.
   
 Some visualisation tools also provide the following:
 
 - **Search** by clicking the search input at the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
 - **Change to and from a grid layout** using the grid icon at the upper left corner of the screen, below the menu icon.
 - **Change view settings** using the icons at the top right corner of the screen.
  + **Cog icon** gets you a view filters panel. This is (at the moment) also where you can download and SVG of the current view.
  + **Alphabetic order icon** (an A-Z beside a downward pointing arrow) if present, re-orders the grid layout alphabetically.
  + **Quantity order icon** (four horizontal bars, left aligned, of decreasing size, together witha downward pointing arrow) if present, re-orders the grid layout by value, largest first.

As you zoom, the navigation panel will appear at the bottom right of the screen. A blue box shows where you have zoomed to within the overall view.

# The Competition Universe
*See how you sit in a whole universe of micro-competitions.*

## Reading the universe map
The universe consists of a large pack of 'planets'. Each of the planets represents the visits arriving from people to a single website.
By default, the view of the universe you are presented with shows the top 100 such 'planets' by total number of search visits tracked. Your website sits at the centre of the universe (naturally). The area of each planet's surface is proportional to the number of visitors from search (whether organic/natural or paid) across 12 months.

If the data is present in the system, you may see one or more additional visual elements on each planet.

 - **Coloured northern polar cap**: area is proportional to the number of search visits to the website which you contested (i.e. where your site was seen in the set of search results that resulted in that visit to a competitor). The colour will be red at the beginning of a taxonomics programme, although this may change as thematic data filters come into play.
 - **White southern polar cap**: area is proportional to the number of search visits to the website which were simply navigational searches to that website (people typing in the brand name of the web site, for example). These are the things you can't really compete for... people who have already decided on that particular site, and just want to navigate there.
 - **Grey middle region**: this is the ocean of opportunity; the search visits that your competitor is winning that you are not contesting.

### Planet Details
Hovering over a planet with a mouse brings up its name in a tool tip. Clicking (or tapping, if using a tablet) makes the name stick in place, enabling you to then click the link to that domain, should you wish. To unstick the tooltip, click the 'X' icon in its top right corner.

### Things to try 
 - **See more of the universe** by clicking on the cog icon at top right. Change it from 'top 100' to, say, top '1000'. You can type it in or move the slider. If you take the slider all the way to the right, it will show you all domains in your market universe. If you do that, you may need to go and make a cup of tea while it lays them out.
 - **Change how the universe is ordered** by clicking the cog icon and changing the value metric from the number of search visits (the default) to:
  + **% contested visits**. This shows the competitors who are most like you in the market goals you are both meeting.
  + **# contested visits**. This shows the competitors whith whom you are, in sheer numbers of people, competing with most fiercely. There are often surprises in here.   
 - **See the universe as a grid** by clicking the grid icon at top left, just below the menu icon. Re-order the grid alphabetically or by value by clicking on the sort view icons at top left, near the cog icon. Click the grid again to return to the normal universe view.

*Note: we are currently seeing some issues with ordering layout for large numbers of competitors in the non-grid view. Small domains are managing to squeeze between gaps left by larger, closer domains. This will be resolved in the next release. In the meantime, look at the grid view for confident ordering.*

### 

# The Market Taxonomy
*Explore what people want, in what number, and the words they use. It also allows you to decide what you want to do about that.*

## The Clusters
The first view you will see shows the first level of the taxonomic hierarchy so far produced as circles. Thematic groups are shown by colour. Click on a circle to expand it into a detailed taxonomy

## A Detailed Taxonomy

## Taxon Triage

## The Detailed Taxon Report


# The Performance Landscape
*Tactical maps of where you are competing now, and where next.*

# The Demand Architecture
*Helps you to radically align your offering, and especially your category hierarchy and web information architecture, with the structure of the demand in the competitive universe in which you operate.*

# Search Integration
*Supercharge your on-site search engine with deep taxonomic, ontologic and semantic goodness.*
